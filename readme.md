The open source code for analysis tools mentioned in "[Ads Recommendation in a Collapsed and Entangled World ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00793)" presented at SIGKDD 2024. We dive into the analysis tools and results regarding several fundamental aspects of recommendation models: the dimensional collapse of embeddings, the correlation between features, and the entanglement of user interests.



ðŸš§ **This code repository is under construction, stay tuned!**
- The analysis of dimensional collapse is from the code for our ICML 2024 paper: [On the Embedding Collapse when Scaling up Recommendation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04400)
- The analysis of feature correlation is from the code for our WWW 2024 paper: [Temporal Interest Network for User Response Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08487)
- The analysis of interest entanglement is from the code for our AAAI 2024 paper: [STEM: Unleashing the Power of Embeddings for Multi-task Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13537)
